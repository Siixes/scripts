# Once we have tools and EGS, create a restore point to move back to between games
# A note per https://techsupportexpert.com/restore-pc-system-restore-point/ 
#     Restoring from a restore point wonâ€™t affect your personal files, 
#     but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates that were installed 
#     after the restore point was created.
# So we can use this restore point between analysis of games, but can't rely on it
# to clean out remnant files/registry keys/etc that could be left unless we reformat
# the disk and start with a clean OS again.
